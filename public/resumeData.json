    "bio":"After three years of self-teaching and an intensive summer at Codassieur's full-stack JavaScript academy, I am excited to join an ambitious development team.  I bring with me a diverse background which includes experiences in Business (start-ups), Economics, and Physics. Since discovering that coding has an oddly calming effect on me, Iâ€™ve explored many languages, including Go, Python, C#, and Java. Eventually I delved into the myriad of current Javascript platforms; to date I have worked with Node.js, Backbone.js, Angular.js, React.js, Express.js, and Koa.js, among others. After completing many online courses, I joined Codaisseur Academy in Amsterdam this summer, which helped me consolidate my education and round out my knowledge of best practices. I am eager to find new challenges and continue to grow as a developer.  I already have 3 years of experience as a Software Project Manager shipping code, which I feel gives me insight into the overall software development processes that is hard to find among junior developers. If you think I might be an asset to your team, please let me know;",
